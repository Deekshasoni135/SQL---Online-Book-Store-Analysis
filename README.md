# 📚 Online Book Store Analysis – SQL Project

## 🔍 Project Overview

In this project I have analyzed an online book store using SQL, working with three datasets: **Books**, **Customers**, and **Orders**. This project allowed me to practice writing SQL queries that solve real business problems and uncover valuable insights.

## 🗂️ Datasets Used

* `Books.csv`: Details about books, including genre, price, stock, and author
* `Customers.csv`: Information about customers, such as country and city
* `Orders.csv`: Purchase transactions linking customers to the books they’ve bought

These datasets are connected through common columns: `Book_ID` and `Customer_ID`.

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated

* Data cleaning and joining using SQL
* Writing complex queries with filters and aggregations
* Using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and `JOIN`
* Subqueries and performance optimization

## 📊 Insights Gained

* Identified the most and least popular book genres based on sales
* Discovered customer purchase patterns and locations with high spending
* Analyzed seasonal trends in book orders (e.g., November 2023)
* Calculated total revenue and average prices by genre
* Found which authors and books were top performers in sales
* Evaluated stock levels to identify inventory gaps
* Recognized repeat customers and high-value orders

These insights not only highlight business performance but also support strategic decisions in marketing, inventory, and customer engagement.
